## Contributing and making edits

### Folder structure

The architectures are documented in [`/architectures`](./architectures). Each markdown file describes one architecture. Inside `/architectures`, there's a folder named [`/diagrams`](./architectures/diagrams), which contains the [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) (`.mmd`) files as well as the `svg` images which are generated from the `mmd` files.

### Editing files

To edit architecture markdown and mermaid files, follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repo
1.  `cd` into it
1.  `yarn install`
1.  `yarn start` (to watch `mmd` files and automatically generate `svg` files)
