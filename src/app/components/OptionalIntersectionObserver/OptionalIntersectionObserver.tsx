/** A wrapper around `react-intersection-observer` that conditionally loads
 * the library only in browsers that support `IntersectionObserver`.
 *
 * For browsers without `IntersectionObserver` support, it just renders the children
 * components immediately.
 *
 * **Why not load a polyfill for `IntersectionObserver`?**
 * The whole point of this component is to avoid loading stuff until
 * it is actually needed. For example, we can delay loading the Facebook
 * comments plugin until the user has scrolled further down the page so
 * that the initial rendering of the page is not affected by the size of
 * the Facebook JS SDK.
 *
 * It does not make sense to load a polyfill that adds to the size of the resources
 * needed to do the initial rendering. Also, the polyfill will have to use a poll strategy
 * to check for intersection, which may lead to janky scrolling.
 *
 * So this is a sort of progressive enhancement where better browsers can delay
 * the load of non-critical resources until they are (almost) visible on the page, and
 * older browsers can still load these resources, albeit in a less efficient way.
